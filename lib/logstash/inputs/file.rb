# Stream events from files, normally by tailing them in a manner
# similar to `tail -0F` but optionally reading them from the
# beginning.
#
# By default, each event is assumed to be one line and a line is
# taken to be the text before a newline character.
# Normally, logging will add a newline to the end of each line written.

# If you would like to join multiple log lines into one event,
# you'll want to use the multiline codec or filter.
#
# The plugin aims to track changing files and emit new content as it's
# appended to each file. It's not well-suited for reading a file from
# beginning to end and storing all of it in a single event (not even
# with the multiline codec or filter).
#
# ==== Reading from remote network volumes
#
# The file input is not tested on remote filesystems such as NFS, Samba, s3fs-fuse, etc. These
# remote filesystems typically have behaviors that are very different from local filesystems and
# are therefore unlikely to work correctly when used with the file input.
#
# ==== Tracking of current position in watched files
#
# The plugin keeps track of the current position in each file by
# recording it in a separate file named sincedb. This makes it
# possible to stop and restart Logstash and have it pick up where it
# left off without missing the lines that were added to the file while
# Logstash was stopped.
#
# By default, the sincedb file is placed in the home directory of the
# user running Logstash with a filename based on the filename patterns
# being watched (i.e. the `path` option). Thus, changing the filename
# patterns will result in a new sincedb file being used and any
# existing current position state will be lost. If you change your
# patterns with any frequency it might make sense to explicitly choose
# a sincedb path with the `sincedb_path` option.
#
# A different `sincedb_path` must be used for each input. Using the same
# path will cause issues. The read checkpoints for each input must be
# stored in a different path so the information does not override.
#
# Sincedb files are text files with four columns:
#
# . The inode number (or equivalent).
# . The major device number of the file system (or equivalent).
# . The minor device number of the file system (or equivalent).
# . The current byte offset within the file.
#
# On non-Windows systems you can obtain the inode number of a file
# with e.g. `ls -li`.
#
# ==== File rotation
#
# File rotation is detected and handled by this input, regardless of
# whether the file is rotated via a rename or a copy operation. To
# support programs that write to the rotated file for some time after
# the rotation has taken place, include both the original filename and
# the rotated filename (e.g. /var/log/syslog and /var/log/syslog.1) in
# the filename patterns to watch (the `path` option). Note that the
# rotated filename will be treated as a new file so if
# `start_position` is set to 'beginning' the rotated file will be
# reprocessed.
#
# With the default value of `start_position` ('end') any messages
# written to the end of the file between the last read operation prior
# to the rotation and its reopening under the new name (an interval
# determined by the `stat_interval` and `discover_interval` options)
# will not get picked up.
