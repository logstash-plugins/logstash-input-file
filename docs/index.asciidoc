=== File input plugin

include::{include_path}/plugin_header.asciidoc[]

==== Description

Stream events from files, normally by tailing them in a manner
similar to `tail -0F` but optionally reading them from the
beginning.

By default, each event is assumed to be one line and a line is
taken to be the text before a newline character.
Normally, logging will add a newline to the end of each line written.
If you would like to join multiple log lines into one event,
you'll want to use the multiline codec or filter.

The plugin aims to track changing files and emit new content as it's
appended to each file. It's not well-suited for reading a file from
beginning to end and storing all of it in a single event (not even
with the multiline codec or filter).

==== Reading from remote network volumes

The file input is not tested on remote filesystems such as NFS, Samba, s3fs-fuse, etc. These 
remote filesystems typically have behaviors that are very different from local filesystems and 
are therefore unlikely to work correctly when used with the file input.

==== Tracking of current position in watched files

The plugin keeps track of the current position in each file by
recording it in a separate file named sincedb. This makes it
possible to stop and restart Logstash and have it pick up where it
left off without missing the lines that were added to the file while
Logstash was stopped.

By default, the sincedb file is placed within the `<path.data>/plugins/inputs/file` directory 
with a filename based on the filename patterns
being watched (i.e. the `path` option). Thus, changing the filename
patterns will result in a new sincedb file being used and any
existing current position state will be lost. If you change your
patterns with any frequency it might make sense to explicitly choose
a sincedb path with the `sincedb_path` option.

A different `sincedb_path` must be used for each input. Using the same
path will cause issues. The read checkpoints for each input must be
stored in a different path so the information does not override.

Sincedb files are text files with four columns:

. The inode number (or equivalent).
. The major device number of the file system (or equivalent).
. The minor device number of the file system (or equivalent).
. The current byte offset within the file.

On non-Windows systems you can obtain the inode number of a file
with e.g. `ls -li`.

==== File rotation

File rotation is detected and handled by this input, regardless of
whether the file is rotated via a rename or a copy operation. To
support programs that write to the rotated file for some time after
the rotation has taken place, include both the original filename and
the rotated filename (e.g. /var/log/syslog and /var/log/syslog.1) in
the filename patterns to watch (the `path` option). Note that the
rotated filename will be treated as a new file so if
`start_position` is set to 'beginning' the rotated file will be
reprocessed.

With the default value of `start_position` ('end') any messages
written to the end of the file between the last read operation prior
to the rotation and its reopening under the new name (an interval
determined by the `stat_interval` and `discover_interval` options)
will not get picked up.

|=======================================================================

Also see <<plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-common-options>> for a list of options supported by all
input plugins.

&nbsp;

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-close_older"]
===== `close_older` 

  * Value type is <<number,number>>
  * Default value is `3600`

The file input closes any files that were last read the specified
timespan in seconds ago.
This has different implications depending on if a file is being tailed or
read. If tailing, and there is a large time gap in incoming data the file
can be closed (allowing other files to be opened) but will be queued for
reopening when new data is detected. If reading, the file will be closed
after closed_older seconds from when the last bytes were read.
The default is 1 hour

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-delimiter"]
===== `delimiter` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * Default value is `"\n"`

set the new line delimiter, defaults to "\n"

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-discover_interval"]
===== `discover_interval` 

  * Value type is <<number,number>>
  * Default value is `15`

How often (in seconds) we expand the filename patterns in the
`path` option to discover new files to watch.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-exclude"]
===== `exclude` 

  * Value type is <<array,array>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

Exclusions (matched against the filename, not full path). Filename
patterns are valid here, too. For example, if you have
[source,ruby]
    path => "/var/log/*"

You might want to exclude gzipped files:
[source,ruby]
    exclude => "*.gz"

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-ignore_older"]
===== `ignore_older` 

  * Value type is <<number,number>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

When the file input discovers a file that was last modified
before the specified timespan in seconds, the file is ignored.
After it's discovery, if an ignored file is modified it is no
longer ignored and any new data is read. By default, this option is
disabled. Note this unit is in seconds.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-max_open_files"]
===== `max_open_files` 

  * Value type is <<number,number>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

What is the maximum number of file_handles that this input consumes
at any one time. Use close_older to close some files if you need to
process more files than this number. This should not be set to the
maximum the OS can do because file handles are needed for other
LS plugins and OS processes.
The default of 4095 is set in filewatch.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-path"]
===== `path` 

  * This is a required setting.
  * Value type is <<array,array>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

The path(s) to the file(s) to use as an input.
You can use filename patterns here, such as `/var/log/*.log`.
If you use a pattern like `/var/log/**/*.log`, a recursive search
of `/var/log` will be done for all `*.log` files.
Paths must be absolute and cannot be relative.

You may also configure multiple paths. See an example
on the <<array,Logstash configuration page>>.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-sincedb_path"]
===== `sincedb_path` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

Path of the sincedb database file (keeps track of the current
position of monitored log files) that will be written to disk.
The default will write sincedb files to `<path.data>/plugins/inputs/file`
NOTE: it must be a file path and not a directory path

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-sincedb_write_interval"]
===== `sincedb_write_interval` 

  * Value type is <<number,number>>
  * Default value is `15`

How often (in seconds) to write a since database with the current position of
monitored log files.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-start_position"]
===== `start_position` 

  * Value can be any of: `beginning`, `end`
  * Default value is `"end"`

Choose where Logstash starts initially reading files: at the beginning or
at the end. The default behavior treats files like live streams and thus
starts at the end. If you have old data you want to import, set this
to 'beginning'.

This option only modifies "first contact" situations where a file
is new and not seen before, i.e. files that don't have a current
position recorded in a sincedb file read by Logstash. If a file
has already been seen before, this option has no effect and the
position recorded in the sincedb file will be used.

[id="plugins-{type}s-{plugin}-stat_interval"]
===== `stat_interval` 

  * Value type is <<number,number>>
  * Default value is `1`

How often (in seconds) we stat files to see if they have been modified.
Increasing this interval will decrease the number of system calls we make,
but increase the time to detect new log lines.
